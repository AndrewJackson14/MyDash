## [2026-04-13] Increased border-radius tokens (R, Ri)

- **Context:** UI felt too sharp/editorial; wanted a warmer, more modern aesthetic
- **Decision:** Increased `R` from 5px → 18px (card-level rounding) and `Ri` from 3px → 10px (buttons, badges, inputs)
- **Alternatives considered:** 40% increase (R=7, Ri=4) felt too subtle; 100% increase (R=10, Ri=6) still conservative
- **Why:** 18/10 hits the soft-modern sweet spot — iOS/macOS Big Sur vibe — while maintaining editorial monochrome palette integrity. Badges now approach pill-shape which feels friendlier.
- **Status:** Shipped
